# NoiViaggioamo - WeRoad Technical Case

<sub><sup>It's basically impossible to find a combination of two words in the field of travel that has not already been used</sup></sub>

This project is my implementation of the Technical case. It is a travel booking application that allows users to search for travel destinations, view details, and complete the booking process.

## Getting Started

Requirements

- Node.js (I used `v22.11.0`)
